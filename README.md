Project 1 – Automating Sales Report (Retail Domain) - The task is to automate the process 
of generating a report on the combined revenue generated in the year 2014 across different 
countries for a sports equipment retailer. This is to be done using VBA code. The tasks 
involve consolidating the monthly sales data into a new worksheet, generating a report with 
unique retailer country names and corresponding total revenue, and adding a button control 
to generate the report.



Project 2 – Incentive Distribution Using VBA (Finance Domain) - The task is to create a 
VBA macro tool that dynamically selects a Sales data file and distributes incentives based on 
the sales amount of product codes in different categories. The macro should create separate 
workbooks for each product category and separate sheets for each product code within the 
category workbooks. The sheets should be named as per the code and include the data 
corresponding to that product code. Finally, all other workbooks should be closed except for 
the macro tool workbook. Screen Updating can be disabled to reduce screen flashes and 
improve processing time.
